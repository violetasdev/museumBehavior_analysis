# Privacy-Preserving Skeleton-Based Analysis of Visitor Behavior in Museums

This repository provides the supplementary material for the paper:

**Privacy-Preserving Skeleton-Based Analysis of Visitor Behavior in Museums**,  
accepted at the **CoMoRe-AI 2026 Workshop**, held in conjunction with the **24th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom 2026)**, Pisa, Italy.

The repository contains the dataset and analysis code used to support the results reported in the paper.

## Dataset

The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo:

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18442234

It contains anonymized, privacy-preserving skeleton data collected in a museum environment, suitable for the analysis of visitor behavior without personal identification.

## Code

This repository includes:

- A Jupyter Notebook used for preprocessing and analysis of the skeleton data.
- A visualization tool for animating and inspecting skeleton trajectories and interactions.

The code is provided to support transparency, reproducibility, and further research based on the published work.
